Since they mentioned it's a small app with just user authentication and theme state, Context API would be the most appropriate choice.`,

React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components.

## Common Hooks

1. **useState** - Manages local state
2. **useEffect** - Handles side effects
3. **useContext** - Consumes context values

### Example Code

\`\`\`javascript
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
\`\`\`

> **Note**: Hooks must be called at the top level of your component.

Let me design a system that:
1. Connects daily actions to the $10M goal
2. Solves the focus problem through clear prioritization
3. Can be reviewed quickly each week

I'll structure this around:
- The "One Thing" methodology for focus
- OKRs for goal alignment
- Weekly/daily tracking templates
- Milestone breakdowns for the $10M target`,

\`\`\`typescript
function debounce<T extends (...args: any[]) => any>(
  func: T,
  wait: number
): (...args: Parameters<T>) => void {
  let timeout: NodeJS.Timeout | null = null;
  
  return (...args: Parameters<T>) => {
    if (timeout) clearTimeout(timeout);
    
    timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      func(...args);
    }, wait);
  };
}

// Usage example
const debouncedSearch = debounce((query: string) => {
  console.log('Searching for:', query);
}, 300);
\`\`\`

This implementation:
- Preserves TypeScript types
- Cancels previous timeouts
- Maintains the original function context`,
